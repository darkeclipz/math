# Math Notes

This MkDocs site contains my math notes, which I started to save here in 2022. The goal of this website is to create a small explanation or reference to the mathematics I encounter, in the hope that I remember it better.

The goal is not to explain it here, it simply acts as a reference. There are tons of material out there from which you can learn this.

## Contents

Currently only the Calculus section is being filled, since my goal is to finish the multi variable calculus section, and vector calculus, since my bachelor Applied Mathematics has skipped these wonderful chapters.
