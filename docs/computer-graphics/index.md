## What is the Shader Compendium?
The Shader Compendium is an attempt to unify tons of functions that are commonly used to write shaders. 
This includes snippets of code for distance functions, SDF operators, lighting models, rendering algorithms, color functions, and many other small utility functions.

## What about licensing?
Every snippet of code will have the original author and their chosen license included.

## Contribute?
I'd love if you would like to contribute, simply create a pull request on GitHub, and I'll gladly add it!
